# Chrun-Customer-Retention-Prediction-System

# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Analytics
Turning customer data into retention intelligence

# 🚀 Project Introduction
Customer churn silently drains business revenue. Retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, visualizing churn patterns, and building a foundation for churn prediction, helping businesses take proactive retention actions.

# 🧠 Business Use Case
Organisations often fail to detect churn until it is too late.

# ⚠️ Challenges Faced
Unnoticed customer dissatisfaction
Revenue decline due to churn
Lack of customer behavior insights
Inefficient retention strategies

# 🎯 Project Objective
To design a structured analytics system that:
Identifies churn-prone customers
Provides actionable insights
Supports business decision-making
Improves long-term customer retention

# 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains telecom customer records, where each row represents a unique customer.
🧾 Feature Categories
👥 Demographic information
